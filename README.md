# BetsBoard
BetsBoard is a stock dashboard based on the wallstreetbets and Quandl API. The web app provides the top 10 trending stock tickers and a search bar where you can find the stock's information.

# User Story 
#### As a user, I want to be able to pull data from the stock market based on tickers I learn about.
#### Additionally, I would like to get a current listing of the top trending stocks on Reddit's WallstreetBets subreddit.
